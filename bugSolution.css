The solution is to increase the specificity of the CSS selector using a more precise selector, such as:

```css
.container > p { color: blue; }
```

This ensures that only direct children (`>` selector) of the `.container` element will be affected, avoiding the unexpected styling in other parts of the website. Alternatively, you can add a class to the specific paragraphs to target, leading to the following:

```css
.container p.specific-paragraph { color: blue; }
```

This is generally a more maintainable option.
